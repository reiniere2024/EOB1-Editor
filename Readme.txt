Hi All,

This is a small editor I made for helping out with Eye of the Beholder I.
During the game I had problems with keeping track of all the map-levels
and in a couple of cases I really got stuck.
With this editor you will be able to keep track of your position on the
maps and (only if you get really stuck) teleport to new locations.

Before you start you should open up the eob1.xml file in the xml-map.
Enter there the path of the Eye of the Beholder II game that you use.
At the moment I assume that that is "C:\Games\Eob1" but if that is not 
correct then you should change it.

When you open the solution in Visual Studio 2008 then don't forget to move all the maps 
(except My Project) to the bin/debug directory when you want to run the code.

Reiniere.
